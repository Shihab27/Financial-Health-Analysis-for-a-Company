# Financial-Health-Analysis-for-a-Company
Analyzing a company's financial data using descriptive statistics and visualizations to evaluate its financial health and uncover trends.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze a company's financial data to assess its financial health using various descriptive and inferential statistical methods. Students will use tools like Python or Excel to complete the analysis and prepare actionable insights based on the findings.

### Part 1: Descriptive Analysis and Data Exploration (Week 1 Submission)
Instructions
#### Dataset Overview

Use a sample dataset containing the following fields:
Date
Revenue
Expenses
Profit
Cash Flow
Debt
Assets
Liabilities
#### Tasks to Perform
##### a. Data Cleaning

Handle missing values.
Identify and address any outliers.
Check for data consistency (e.g., Profit = Revenue - Expenses).
##### b. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Compute descriptive statistics for each variable (mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc.).
Create visualizations:
Line charts for revenue and expenses trends over time.
Box plots to identify the spread and outliers in profit and cash flow.
Pie chart or bar chart showing proportions of expenses categories (if available).
##### c. Correlation Analysis

Calculate and interpret correlations between revenue, expenses, profit, and debt.
Identify which variables are strongly correlated and discuss possible reasons.
##### d. Deliverables

Submit Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file) with data cleaning, EDA, and correlation analysis and at the end of the notebook use a Markdown cell to summarize your findings from the descriptive statistics and EDA and discuss any anomalies or trends you noticed."

### Part 2: Inferential Analysis and Insights (Week 2 Submission)
Dataset: Download it from this link <a href="#">Link Text</a> </br>
</br>
#### Dataset Overview

Continue using the same dataset from Week 1.
#### Tasks to Perform
##### a. Hypothesis Testing

Scenario 1: Test if the average monthly profit is greater than a predefined benchmark value (e.g., $10,000).
Scenario 2: Test if the average revenue and expenses are significantly different.
Use t-tests or z-tests where applicable.
##### b. P-value Interpretation

For each hypothesis test, explain the p-value and whether you reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.
##### c. Trend Analysis

Perform a year-over-year analysis of revenue and profit growth.
Calculate growth rates and identify periods of significant change.
##### d. Financial Ratios and Insights

Calculate financial ratios such as:
Profit Margin = Profit / Revenue
Debt-to-Asset Ratio = Debt / Assets
Current Ratio = Assets / Liabilities
Compare these ratios to industry benchmarks and provide insights.
e. Deliverables

Submit Python file (.py file) with hypothesis testing, trend analysis, and financial ratio calculations and at the end of the notebook use a Markdown cell to summarize your findings from the descriptive statistics and EDA and discuss any anomalies or trends you noticed.
